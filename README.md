The intent of this tool is to allow you quickly tweak all available ReadText properties.
Features:
Generates HTML document that displays both the original image and the version that OCR "sees."
Allows a pick list of properties you would like to use.
Simple mode reads text from a live instance of TutorialSUT.
Advanced mode uses a difficult and ugly UI example.
Custom mode allows you to connect to a SUT of your choosing and pass the search area from which you want to read.
